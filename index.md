### Beginnings: Family & Resilience

To talk about my professional career, I have to go a bit into my personal life. Nice to meet you, my name is Lucas, the youngest child of five. I grew up in a poor and dangerous neighborhood on the outskirts of northeastern Brazil. From as far back as I can remember, I worked alongside my family in my father’s small neighborhood bakery. All of us brothers took part in the pipeline of breadmaking — selling, mixing, baking, delivering. As we got older, we took on more responsibility. By 17, we were practically experts in the bakery environment.

It was hard work, but I have good memories of that time. Working together created a strong bond among us siblings. My parents sacrificed a lot to put me in a private school, something my brothers didn’t have, and that effort was life-changing. I’ve always felt like I owe them for the way they supported me on my school journey.

### How I Found Programming

My professional journey really began by chance. At 17, I had no idea what programming was. One Saturday, while riding with my cousin to a *loteria* (a place where people used to pay bills and play the lottery), he mentioned a new hire at his job, a systems analyst earning about R$2,000/month (~$370 USD). At the time, I earned only R$280/month helping in the bakery. My father’s business was deteriorating, and I felt pressure to find a way to support my family. That salary number stuck in my mind.

I went home, Googled around, and discovered a new *Sistemas de Informação* course at Universidade Fortaleza. It was literally the last day to register for the entry test. The course was short, 2.5 years  and promised good chances of employment before finishing. That was enough for me to jump in.

At first, programming was overwhelming. I had no idea what Java or object-oriented programming even meant. Concepts like loops or classes felt like magic. From a class of 57, only 13 of us finished on time. Many times I thought about giving up, but I reminded myself: I didn’t have a choice. This course was my best chance to give my parents a better life. Over time, something clicked. I fell in love with programming. I dare to say today: I love coding, and I’m grateful for everything this profession has given me and my family.

### My First Internship: The Hardest Chapter

My first real step into the industry came with a stroke of luck. One professor announced that his company had an internship opening: Java, 10am–6pm, R$300 monthly (~$55 USD). On the day of the test, I was the only student who showed up, so I got the position by walkover. Later, the professor told me the spot had almost been filled by someone else, but fate (and persistence) worked in my favor. That was the real start of my career.

My first internship was also the hardest time of my life. At that point, my hometown was among the most violent cities in Brazil, and tragedy touched my family I lost friends family members and relatives to that violence. Balancing grief, a full-time internship, and night classes was overwhelming. Many nights I couldn’t even go home because of conflicts near the bus stop, crashing instead at a friend’s house and going to work the next day in the same clothes.

My performance suffered, and at one point my manager even suggested I return to my father’s bakery. But going back wasn’t an option, I knew the bakery couldn’t give us a future. So I pressed on. Slowly, concepts like Java, MVC, and JSF began to make sense, and my confidence grew. Eventually, I knew it was time to move forward, and when the opportunity to join a startup appeared, I seized it.

That transition, from almost being fired to landing my first ‘real’ job, taught me that resilience is sometimes the most important skill an engineer can have.

### Hallive: My First Startup (2014)

2014 was my last year of college, and in the second quarter I joined **Hallive**, a small startup building a social network focused on live streaming. Imagine Facebook, but instead of a profile picture at the top, you could instantly go live and share what you were doing  years before Instagram Lives became mainstream.

We were a tiny team: one designer and three developers (I was the most junior). Despite that, I had the chance to participate in **product decisions**, give input on features, and learn about tradeoffs. It was the first time I felt that my ideas mattered in shaping a product.

To accelerate development, we used a framework called **PHP Social Engine** as the foundation. My main challenge was integrating **RED5 streaming** into that PHP structure. PHP was easy to start with but dangerous to manage at scale  *“with great power comes great responsibility”*. After months of JavaScript, CSS, and PHP, we delivered our MVP: users could add friends, get notified when someone started a live, and join the broadcast.

That experience taught me what it really means to build a social product from scratch  and how tough it is to do with limited resources.

### Hard Moments at Home

During this same period, my father’s bakery went bankrupt after a violent incident in my neighborhood. It was one of the darkest times in my life.

I looked for more stability and, since my Hallive schedule was afternoons (1pm–7pm), I took a second role in the mornings. That meant leaving home at 6am, taking three buses, working, studying at night, and only arriving back around 11pm. It was exhausting, but necessary.

### Softlog Internship: Learning Legacy Systems (2014)

Through a college referral, I joined **Softlog** as a morning intern. This was my first contact with **.NET, SQL, and true legacy code**. My responsibilities included generating reports for customers, creating simple input screens, and making adjustments to a very old logistics system.

The biggest challenge was that the system had no tests and had been touched by many developers over the years. A “simple” query change could break critical logistics flows. Over time, I learned to identify fragile parts of the system, anticipate risks, and tread carefully a lesson that stayed with me throughout my career.

### Graduation & Moving Forward

At the same time, I was finishing my **final graduation project (TCC)**. Between Hallive, Softlog, university, and family responsibilities, my routine was insane. But I made it: I successfully graduated at the end of 2014.

Hallive gave me the thrill of startup life, Softlog taught me caution in legacy systems, and college gave me the formal foundation. Together, they marked the **end of my student years and the true beginning of my professional journey**.

### Promotion, End of Hallive & First Steps into Legacy (2015)

Not long after graduation, I received my **first promotion**. That allowed me to quit my second job and finally focus on one place for the first time in months I felt like I could breathe. But in early 2015, Hallive was discontinued. Brazil’s economy went into crisis, and our foreign investor pulled out. It was the first time I saw a **good team and a promising product fail** for reasons beyond the work itself. A tough but valuable lesson: effort and talent alone don’t guarantee success.

Soon after, I rejoined the market and landed at **JPLM**, a more innovative cell inside the same logistics group where I had interned before. The work was similar, .NET, reports, legacy systems but with new responsibilities: **API integrations** and even a **mobile app for truck drivers**. The app consumed routes from a legacy .NET backend and gave drivers a checklist and real-time location tracking.

It was my **first taste of mobile development** (Android), and I loved it, until I ran into my first **UX problem**. The customer’s phones were so small that drivers kept mis-tapping buttons (accidentally cancelling routes). After feedback, I had to redesign the UI, making everything oversized. It was my first lesson that user experience can be more important than elegant code.

At JPLM I also had to touch a **30-year-old Delphi system** with massive files (80k+ lines of code). Scary at first, but I learned to dive in and make changes without breaking everything. Over months, I got used to SQL monstrosities, legacy patches, and fragile paths. Still, after a while I felt stagnant bored of endless maintenance and convinced I didn’t want to spend my career repeating the same tasks.

### A Coincidence that Changed Everything

And here’s where fate stepped in. Every day I had lunch at the same “prato feito” spot in front of the office. One day, for no particular reason, I decided to walk further, about 2km, to a mall food court. There I ran into **two old classmates**: one from high school, one from college. They told me about the company they were working at a small, innovative shop filled with young engineers building systems on demand for clients using **JavaScript, Python, Angular** and other modern stacks. It sounded like a dream compared to my legacy grind.

They referred me, and to my surprise, the same day I got a message: the boss wanted to meet me that afternoon. There was only one problem I was still at JPLM, in uniform, with no transport available. So I walked 3–4 km to the interview, sweating but determined. I waited an hour, then finally got to speak with the manager. I told him the truth: I didn’t know these new technologies, but I would give my best to learn.

He offered me the job, even at a lower salary than I was earning, and I accepted immediately. I knew that working with modern technologies would **open doors for my future**. And it did, this was the real start of my journey with **cutting-edge stacks**, and the beginning of my time at **Deway**.

### Deway: Learning Fast, Failing Fast (2015–2017)

For my surprise, I was hired at Deway, probably thanks to the good words of my colleagues. Looking back, I’m still impressed at how Deway managed to bring together so many smart and ambitious young engineers under one roof.

The business model was simple: **clients came with a dream, sales promised the dream on impossible deadlines, and engineers like us had to deliver**. Many nights ended with pizza at the office, racing against the clock. It was the classic *software factory* model.

I’m grateful to Deway for opening the doors for me. For the first time, I had the chance to work with **modern stacks,** JavaScript, Python, Angular, Django.

**Encontremed — My First “Real” App**

In my first week I was thrown into a live project: **Encontremed**, a mobile app to help people find doctors nearby ([still on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amhp.esm&hl=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com)). I attended alignment meetings with clients and felt totally lost when asked technical questions. But I grew into the role, and over time earned the client’s trust. Years later he even invited me back to lead a new phase of the app.

Technically, this was my first time seeing **frontend and backend separated into specialized teams**. Until then, I had always worked end-to-end. Using **Django** for APIs and **Angular** for the frontend felt exciting and shipping to both iOS and Android with JavaScript was mind-blowing to me at the time.

Another thing I loved at Deway was the rotation: when one project finished, you’d quickly be moved to another, meeting new people and making friendships that last until today.

**The Bet House — A Tough Lesson**

In 2016, I heard about **React** for the first time. It wasn’t common in Brazil yet, but it soon became central to my story. Deway’s most important client was a betting house, similar to Bet365. At first, the frontend was rewritten in **Angular 1**, but when it went live, performance collapsed. Angular’s change-detection model couldn’t handle thousands of constantly updating odds. The project was scrapped.

That’s when I was invited to join the project and tasked with learning **React and Node** to rebuild it. I didn’t love the business (I’m not a fan of betting), but I accepted for two reasons:

- The opportunity to learn cutting-edge tech.
- The client offered a punctuality bonus of R$1000/month, arriving on time was never a problem for me, even with 40km of bus rides every day.

I worked mostly alone, building a **live football betting system** that handled thousands of odds changing in real time with **Node.js, Socket.io, and React**. It was stressful but incredibly educational.

The bad part was the environment:

- No Git allowed — we passed code on pen drives because the owners didn’t trust us.
- Features were added or removed on a whim, depending on which partner shouted louder.
- At one point, someone was literally paid to sit in the office just to watch us work, even though he didn’t understand code.

In the end, I delivered the project, saved some money, and left. Ironically, soon after, the betting house itself collapsed in a scandal. During one Brazilian championship round, almost all underdog teams won, and customers walked away with huge payouts. Instead of paying, the owners vanished, and my colleagues who stayed never got their salaries. The “trust issues” of the owners turned out to be justified only against themselves.

**What I Took From Deway**

Deway was chaotic, exhausting, and full of lessons:

- **Technical**: My first React/Node project, building for scale, real-time updates.
- **Professional**: How sales promises can kill engineering quality.
- **Personal**: Sometimes you need to leave a project that doesn’t align with your values.

Still, Deway prepared me for my next leap: moving to São Paulo, the biggest tech hub in Latin America, and continuing my growth.

### Hyperlocal: Ambition, Lessons, and Burnout (2018–2019)

At the end of 2017 (or beginning of 2018), I got an opportunity to join **Hyperlocal**, an on-site company in São Paulo. I was 23, my girlfriend was 20, and together we moved 2,000 km from home to a city where we knew no one.

I have to admit: I got the job by bluffing. They were looking for someone with **React Native experience**. I didn’t have it — but I had React, and I trusted myself to learn.

### Building the App From Scratch

The company wanted a **mobile app for the beauty industry** something that allowed customers to:

- Find salons nearby
- Search specialists and services
- Book appointments
- Buy products (with upsells from salon professionals)

I was responsible for **architecting the app from scratch** with React Native, React Router, and Redux. The APIs were already there, but the frontend was all on me.

The deadline was brutal: the app had to be ready for *Beauty Week* in September. I worked 10–12 hours a day, often Saturdays, pushing hard to deliver. Along the way, my personal life collapsed I lost my girlfriend during the project.

Eventually, I asked for help, and two engineers joined. By then I had an MVP working, so I mentored them — my **first real experience mentoring engineers**. Together we shipped the app on time, becoming the **first mobile app to integrate with the VTEX marketplace**, which had previously been web-only.

But there was a hard lesson: **even if the tech works, the product can still fail**. We hadn’t validated with salon professionals, who were too busy to use the product recommendation feature the app’s “core.” The project died despite the code being solid.

**Pivot to Salon ERP**

After new investment, Hyperlocal pivoted: shutting down three legacy systems (Delphi, PHP, Java) and building a **new ERP platform for salons**. I joined as one of two frontend engineers (React, Redux, TypeScript). The backend team had 12 people, but we mocked APIs to start moving.

My biggest challenge was implementing the **scheduling system,** like Google Calendar, but with professionals instead of days. At first, I underestimated it and wasted weeks with an unfit library. I admitted the failure, restarted, and eventually delivered a custom drag-and-drop scheduling system handling conflicts, overlaps, and multi-appointments. It was one of the most complex algorithms I’ve built in JavaScript, and I’m still proud of it today.

**Burnout**

But the cost was high. I spent nearly two years working 10–12 hours daily. After a round of investments, the culture turned toxic: extreme pressure, promises of equity, high turnover, competition over collaboration.

My body sent me warnings I gained 20kg, had sleepless nights, eye twitches, tingling. I ignored them. Until one night, I called my old manager, met him at a bar, and broke down crying. I couldn’t step into the office again.

It was my **first and unique burnout**. At the time, I thought I was weak I had faced much harder things in life. But I learned that **burnout is real, and no one is immune**. Working long hours for short bursts may happen, but doing it for years is not sustainable.

Still, Hyperlocal gave me brothers and sisters I consider family to this day. Pain sometimes brings people closer. But I knew it was time to move on.

**Preparing for Nubank**

After slowing down, I prepared myself for **Nubank’s exhaustive hiring process**. I studied for three months, applied, and with some luck and a lot of effort  I made it.

At Nubank, I found the collaborative environment I had been missing, and a healthier pace that allowed me to grow without breaking.

### Nubank: From Platform to Global Scale to Crypto (2019–Present)

At the end of 2019, I joined **Nubank**, starting in the **Control Plane platform team**. We were a small group, but filled with brilliant engineers. The mission of the platform area was to **boost developer productivity across Nubank**, and our team focused on evolving the back-office platform  similar to Spotify’s Backstage built with **ClojureScript, Re-frame, Clojure, and Ant Design**.

It was another moment in my career where I had to **learn everything from scratch**: Lisp syntax, functional programming, Datomic, Kubernetes, AWS, Grafana, Splunk. I discovered what it meant to build for **millions of customers** instead of a few.

I’ll never forget my first week: a meeting with the Director of Platform and Nubank’s founders. The entire meeting was in English, and I barely knew 5 colors and how to count to 20. I nodded and pretended to understand, but left feeling like a fraud. That moment motivated me to hire a private English teacher for two years, today I collaborate daily with colleagues worldwide.

**Highlight:** we reduced the time to create a new Clojure service from *two weeks* to just *3–4 hours*.

### Investments: Building Money Boxes (2020–2024)

After recovering from my Hyperlocal burnout, I wanted to return to product work, closer to customers. I moved to the **Investments area**, where we were creating **Money Boxes** (*Caixinhas*): a new product to help customers save and invest towards goals without needing financial knowledge.

The MVP offered funds and RDBs, and was a huge success: millions of customers, billions of reais invested, and eventually competitors mimicked our product.

At first, I was focused on execution, building features end-to-end in Clojure, from mobile screens to backend services. But as the product matured, my responsibilities grew:

- **Locked RDB Assets** — Led the design and delivery of this feature, balancing yield vs. liquidity. The challenge wasn’t just technical but convincing design and product teams to avoid unnecessary complexity. I wrote my first **RFC**, broke the work into milestones, and led two engineers to ship it.
- **CDB Integration** — A more complex feature requiring cross-team alignment. I drove architectural decisions, facilitated whiteboards, and wrote documentation. I built it mostly solo and later fixed a concurrency bug caused by overlapping balance updates from external APIs. We solved it with a **CAS versioning strategy** to ensure data consistency across distributed pods.

Sometimes the impact was visible instantly, a bug in production could put Money Boxes in Brazil’s Twitter trending topics within minutes. It was both terrifying and motivating.

**Global Investments: From Brazil to LatAm (2024–2025)**

As Money Boxes grew, Nubank launched similar products in **Colombia (Cajitas)** and **Mexico**. Initially, teams built country-specific solutions, but that wasn’t scalable. I joined efforts to design a **global, country-agnostic Money Boxes platform**.

Working closely with a Staff Engineer, I helped plan and implement a core system to unify BR/MX/CO. We migrated data, deprecated old services, and aligned multiple teams on trade-offs. There were hard conversations, scope cuts, and even mistakes (like duplicating Mexican boxes during a migration, quickly fixed before users were impacted).

By the end, we had laid the foundation for a **global investment platform** one that could scale to future markets.

### Crypto Broker: Reliability at Scale (2025–Present)

Today I’m part of Nubank’s **Crypto Broker team**, responsible for all buy/sell operations of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Our system integrates with multiple providers (Paxos, Wintermute, Coinbase, etc.) to give customers reliable access to assets.

Key contributions:

- **New Asset Enablement** — Designed and delivered the feature for seamless onboarding of new assets across providers.
- **Price Redundancy Engine** — Architected a decision engine that ingests multiple price feeds and applies rules to select the most reliable and cost-efficient option. If one provider fails, we instantly switch, ensuring customers never see downtime.
- **Operational Excellence** — On-call rotations, monitoring, incident response.
- **Collaboration** — Whiteboards, RFCs, mentoring new engineers, and sharing best practices in distributed systems.

### Lessons From Nubank

Nubank has been the most transformative chapter of my career. It taught me:

- How to build for **millions of users** with reliability.
- How to lead through **documentation, persuasion, and collaboration**, not just code.
- How to scale products from **local experiments to global platforms**.
- How to balance **technical ambition with operational resilience**.

### Closing Note

So this is a little of my journey as an engineer. I hope it gives you an overview of the kind of professional I am, and maybe even helps you understand the person behind the code.

If you’d like to talk, please reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-souza-a45421151) or send me an email at [**lucas47s.s47@gmail.com](mailto:lucas47s.s47@gmail.com),** it will be a pleasure to connect.

For my next step, I’m aiming for a remote-first environment that allows me to stay close to my family. I’ve recently become a father, and I’m in a phase of life where I’m both incredibly happy and, at the same time, navigating the uncertainties of a job transition. There’s never a “perfect” time to make a move, but I believe growth often comes when we take the leap anyway.

I’ll be upfront: right now, I don’t have the energy to grind LeetCode-style interviews. What excites me is not passing algorithm puzzles, but building real systems, solving customer problems, and contributing to teams.

I’m looking for a place with less bureaucracy and more autonomy, where engineers are trusted to make decisions and move fast. Ideally, a smaller, fast-paced company where my background can create meaningful impact from day one.

If that resonates with you, let’s talk.
